# a turing machine simulator

here, we describe turing machine by a string. each line denoting a transition between machine states.

then the input string is fed into the machine which is the so called tape.  
after that simulation begins.

this program will have 2 modes: answer and show. in mode answer, the simulation will happen as fast as possible and answer of machine will be shown after it halts.  
in the show mode, machine will be simulated step by step and an appropriate output will be shown denoting each state of machine and modifications on the tape
